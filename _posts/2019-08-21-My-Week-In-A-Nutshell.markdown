It's pretty hard to justify what it is like to be busy as a student when the world assumes you're not. A student also has
equally busy day, as any other 9 to 5 workers or a house wife or any other people who earn for a living. This busy city life
definitely bores your soul and makes it wonder why you're even living. In the midst of pollution and population, there are so many
things that you miss to reckon. Things that may have power to move your soul, or the things that could bring a smile to your face.

To be honest, my morning starts at 5 with a cup of hot lemon with ginger honey. Next thing, I rush out from home to catch a 5:45 bus
to my college. Half the time, i'm asleep on the bus, and most of the time in class. Upon reaching home, I take a nap, go to the gym
and prepare myself for the next day nonchalantly. And if you're day looks like this, perhaps you forget that there is a world outside,
which can give you enough reasons to feel that the life you're living might not be that bad as it seems. And so, last Saturday
it clicked in my mind to note those many-few small-big things that made me smile. Today, I bring you a blog based on it.
Mind you, I am extremely sensitive, so even you if you bring me a cup of water, I might cry.

<h2 class="text-primary">On the streets of Basantapur</h2> 
While strolling on the streets of Basantapur, a lot of kids try to convince you to buy a bottle of water from them. I was also a part of
their small initiative to sell the water. Two kids randomly came to me and offered me to buy one. I on the other hand always
carry a bottle of water with me. So instead I convinced them that I carry my own bottle. But because they are kids, they kept nagging.
It was quite difficult to escape them as well, one because they were super cute and two, they were kids. 

Next thing I did was asked if they were thirsty. They denied at first but later accepted that they were. I offered them the water I had.
They drank it like they were thirsty for a while. When I asked if their thirst was quenched, they happily said yes.
After a little chat with them, I remembered I had peanut butter cookies ordered and received from Pokhara that morning.
I gave them the cookies , they grabbed them all. And why not! They may not have eaten good since who knows how long. 
They took a bite and I waited for their reaction. 

I still remember their face when they found it to be really good. It still makes me smile every time I think of it.

Today, while writing this, I hope they are having a good time and getting the opportunity to go to school everyday.

<h2 class="text-primary">Crossing the busy street at Mitrapark</h2> 
Lack of self awareness has changed the way of Traffic in Kathmandu. If there aren't any traffic police in every junction, then
there obviously is a hassle of vehicles and pedestrians. In situations as such, I definitely have a hard time crossing roads every single time.
Monday was something similar. I was trying to cross one of the busiest streets of Mitrapark. Few others were easily crossing it. Easily
might not be the appropriate word but for an agyrophobic, they made it look simple.

I kept struggling for a while when a man around his sixties came to me and asked if I was scared. I was definitely scared but 
couldn't admit it properly. Out of nowhere, he asked me if I have watched the classic Bollywood blockbuster Sholay and if I 
remember a dialogue of Mr. Amitabh Bachhan. I had watched the movie time and again but was confused on which dialogue he was
specifically talking about. He reminded me as he went on saying it, "JO DAR GAYA SAMJHO MAR GAYA". Which if translated to english 
is if you're scared, you're dead. 

He acquainted me to the other side of the road and asked me to brave. I hope he is happily living in his sixties. I wish him good health.


<h2 class="text-primary">Struggling with period pain</h2> 
When I think about periods, and that women have an average of 450 periods in their lifetime, I feel really proud of women all around
the globe. Cramps, back pain, mood swings, "never-quick-enough" painkillers, hot water bags and hot showers are
quite on demand and exercise and social plans are off the hook. It's basically that
time of the month where you pretend to be okay but on the inside, your'e dying.

Sometimes, my pain are the worst ones. In most of the cases they are.
You could even say it a coincidence, but there's one person in my life, who by the grace of god, has always taken care of me when I feel like ending my world. 
That person has stood in the scorching heat with me when I was looking for warmth in some 29 degree celsius, always managed to rush to the drug store to get me medicines, 
and come back with snacks. 

To that someone, who held me when I fainted multiple times, who brought me hot waters and medicines and snacks that I love,
and who made sure I ate, I hope I can always pay it forward whenever I get the chance to. Also, I wish good luck, prosperity 
and a loyal life partner.

<h2 class="text-primary">Deciding to be decisive</h2> 
There's this weird practice of Nepalese people of believing in astrology and following astrologer's suggestions. That's how
last week I also ended up with a so called Astrologer that scans the fingerprints of each finger and prepares a 40 page
documentation on things I have been carrying since birth.

The so called astrologer is a specialist of Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP). If you are new to this then NLP is a scientific 
approach to communication, personal development and psychotherapy. When my official report arrived and I had a private counselling
session, I was told that I have a higher gross motor skills and that is why I cannot say NO to anyone and anything. Also, because of
it I am a confused person and cannot take any decisions because higher the gross motor skills, the more the thoughts are processed which
makes decision making a tough job.

I had a bit of a chat with one of my closest friends about this and what he had to say was, I can completely understand you 
because a part of me knows you better than anything but also because I am somewhat like you. And that's where he told me that
both of us will work on ourselves and that I will never have to feel alone when struggling on a daily basis.

When I retaliate what he said to me, I think I am very blessed to have someone like him in my life. And also, if he was the one
to share, I might not be able to tell him that both of us will work on it. I hope I can always be available to him whenever he needs
a helping hand.
