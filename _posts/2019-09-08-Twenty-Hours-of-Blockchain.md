Every year our college introduces a series of workshops related to information technology. These workshops are made available to students so that they can learn something that is fresh in the real world and can help them get a head start in a particular field. With all the heated stories regarding crypto-currency, bitcoin, smart contract, and whatnot, I always wanted to know what is the real deal regarding blockchain technology? What makes it different and revolutionary? So, I decided to seize this opportunity and choose Blockchain without giving a second thought. Little did I know, I would be so fascinated about it that I would want to share my 20 hours journey with blockchain, to my dear readers.



Unlike other technology, blockchain is relatively new and there are not many people who have been engaging in this technology. So, it must have been a great challenge for the administrative department to find the instructors suitable to teach the course. Nevertheless, they found cool developers who devoted themselves to Blockchain in Nepal. They were the blockchain geeks and worked in a company named eSatya. 


Manjik dai and Ruchin dai instructed us in the very first class. They were very enthusiastic and proactive. One could see their passion for the technology just by glancing at their t-shirt with the print "Blockchain Guy". They seemed to be very excited to find people sharing common interest concerning Blockchain technology. 


The first class was not directly about setting up the coding environment. It was about understanding why we were in that class and what we were about to learn. Further, the class also came up into clear understanding on what eSatya does for Nepal in the context of Blockchain. The class gradually became more interactive while discussing the stupidest curious stuff one could have. Afterward, we had a short presentation given by our instructors and the very first class ended with the installation of all the required materials to dig into the blockchain for the future lessons.  



The 20 hours of Blockchain was divided into five Saturdays, each of four hours. I would like to describe the first lesson as exhilarating the second lesson was not monotonous either, but we could fairly say who wanted to learn the subject in an indulging fashion and who felt like an obligation to make up for their attendance. 

As far as we knew, blockchain was used for the transaction of digital crypto-currency. The next step was to understand every single element that made transaction possible in any system that blockchain encapsulates. The small concept like hash, block, tokens, nonce, proof of work, were discussed with interactive examples. Later we learned how blockchain is a distributed system and has the power to replace the traditional centralized system. The second class was also about understanding the status of blockchain in Nepal, especially when bitcoin is illegal here.


The next four hours of the third week was the turning point. It was now finally the time to get our hands dirty and start coding and write contracts. We'd been hearing about contracts for the last two classes so much that there was an immense urge to kill our curiosity and know more about it in a technical way. When finally getting into it, we were introduced to Solidity; Solidity is an object-oriented programming language for writing smart contracts. Solidity was a challenge itself. We had to have good knowledge about javascript, but then learning a different programming language was a bite off more than we could chew. But we did it anyway, with the help of our instructors who pushed us beyond our limits.


Manjik dai told us to think about a project which could be anything where blockchain could be implemented. Once we decide our project, we could then start the project-based learning. Groups were divided and after a few minutes of brainstorming, we had a project idea ready. We decided to do a tax payment system and we were asked to pitch our idea formally into documents. Everything felt rushed at the moment because the only time we invested ourselves in this was in the Saturday classes. Having said that we would deliver a pitch anyways, exams awaited us the coming week. It was next to impossible to manage time for both the exams and project.

After exams, we had three sleepless nights to deliver what we had thought to design. Despite the fact that not all promised details were made exactly the same, we felt victorious when we had something to show in front of everyone. Our mentors were very happy for us for trying something we had never done before. 


To cut a long story short, Blockchain classes felt like an achievement at the end. I am very happy to have mentors who are either a text or call away from help.

If you feel like knowing more about eSatya and blockchain itself then you can contact me.
