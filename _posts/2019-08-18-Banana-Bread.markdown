BAKING AT HOME INDEED IS A PLEASURE.

My dear foodies, I know you have landed on this page after randomly scrolling on several pages,
trying to find that one thing which might actually catch your guards off. Having a healthy diet but also the fact that your 
sweet tooth wants something pleasing as well as interesting at the same time. It's probably weekend and now you prefer your bed more 
than anything in the world so you decide not to go out. And this is how you wonder if baking is what you want to do. 
Be it the ingredients, equipments or the time, something always has been stopping you from taking a lead, but not anymore. Today, 
I present you a recipe that you'll probably would stick for your entire life. This recipe involves making a bread which is indeed an art 
of cooking, not everyone can master at. Every baker has at least ten thousand stories to tell until they make a perfect slice of bread. 
I do have my own share of stories. The rest is history! So my friend, if you've ever thought of making your piece of bread at home, 
let's indulge in this recipe. I might have forgotten to mention about banana being the king here, but never mind, let's make a banana bread today.

Another interesting thing you might find here is that I do not have an oven at home. Instead it's the microwave.

>   Baking in the microwave is very tricky as one minute you'll have the best bread ever, and the other, you'll have it all
>   burned. You really need to be cautious about what's going on inside the oven.

I have come up with this recipe after failing numerous times. Sometimes, the batter would get runny, the other times I
would overcook it. Because I do not have an oven and need to use a microwave, it always used to be frustrating when I would try to make it the best and
it would turn out to be inedible. Make sure you bake it with love. That way, you can finally get a
perfect piece of food to eat and enjoy.

> Failing teaches you how to master it the next time. Also, would love to hear your horror baking stories. Even if the bread turned out 
> inedible. The first time I tried this, I burned half the bread. So it's alright. You'll have it even better than most famous shops one day.
> And if possible, we might even open a shop together. What do you say?
