Interestingly, things turn out great without oil as well.

Past two months of my life has turned complete upside down as I had a sudden urge to loose weight. Things would have been 
pretty normal if I was slightly overweight but I was obese for my height and age. I stand about 4.11 from the ground and 
would weight almost 132.2 where according to the calculations, I should be no more than 112.4lbs. That's when getting in shape
became important to me. I joined the gym, started working out about two hours a day and ate in calorie deficit. I repeated the same
pattern of foods for breakfast, lunch and dinner. On most of the days, I would even avoid dinners. Following the same boring food pattern
was difficult and I would crave for things I used to hate. I wanted to eat amazing chicken, deep fried momos with hot sauce,
and all those things that would not allow me to loose weight. For your information, Nepali cuisines need a lot of oil as well.
That's where things get rough.

Right at this time, my uncle came with Air Fryer to visit us. He brought it from China and wanted us to try it out. Initially,
I had no idea what it would do but later I can state that it "changed my life". I've prepared hundreds of food and the same food
hundred times and I eat them all guilt free. Getting in shape has turned my mindset into counting calories and air fryer
has successfully been able to remove that extra 110 calories from my plate.

If you've got a air fryer too then why not indulge in my recipes then. This time I will be writing about making delicious 
soft and tender chicken with air fryer. If you want it to be extremely juicy you can add the oil. As far as I do this, I
avoid the oil. In Nepal, the completely dried meat is also called chicken sekuwa. Let's get started then!

<h2 class="text-primary">Ingredients</h2>   

1. Chicken with bones (1 kgs)
2. Curd (One small cup)
3. Salt (1 and half teaspoon)
4. Turmeric (1 teaspoon)
5. Red Chilly Powder (1 teaspoon)
5. Nepali Chilly (Akabare) Paste (1 teaspoon)
5. Jeera Seed (Half teaspoon)
6. Carom Seed (Half teaspoon)
7. 2-3 Cardamons
8. Coriander
9. Mint
10. Two Onions 
11. Half a garlic
12. Half a ginger

<h2 class="text-primary">Equipments</h2>

1. Air Fryer
2. Blender
3. Saucepan 
4. Bowl

<h2 class="text-primary">Directions</h2>

1. Chop the onion into small pieces and keep then inside the air fryer for about 5 minutes in 180 degree. While 
the onion keeps on getting caramelized, heat a saucepan to roast cardamons, jeera seed and carom seed. You can roast them
for about 2 to 3 minutes.
2. When both the onions and the seeds are done, turn them into the blender. Slice the ginger and garlic into small pieces 
and add them into the blender. Add mint, coriander, salt, turmeric, chilly powder, paste and curd into the blender and blend t
all of these ingredients into a smooth paste.
3. Take the chicken into a big bowl and add the paste to it. Mix it well and leave the chicken for minimum two hours. I
generally like to marinate my meat overnight, but you can do it as much as you like.
4. When you start being impatient about the chicken that's when you'll know it's ready to get inside the fryer. Gently place
the chicken into the fryer. Do not overload. Add only if the counter space is free.
5. You can do it first for 5 minutes in about 180 to 190 degree. Come back, shake it well, turn the pieces upside down
and keep it back again for another 5 minutes. Voila! You'll get somewhat grilled and somewhat fried chicken two in one at
the same time.

       
<h2 class="text-primary">Things to be Cautious About</h2>

<h4 class="text-primary">Chicken</h4>
A lot of air frying recipes of chicken would want you to cook it without marination but this Nepali style chicken goes completely
fine inside the air fryer.

<h4 class="text-primary">Keep Shaking it like a boss</h4>
Shaking the fryer would allow everything inside it to move and allow the hot air to circulate to every surface of each food.
I recommend you do it more often like in between every five minutes.

<h4 class="text-primary">Do not overload</h4>
As small as the counter is, that's how small portion we should be keeping inside it. You would definitely not be staking foods
one after another in your usual pan or even in the over and that goes same with the fryer.
Fryers do come with racks these days, but you shouldn't overload it anyways. This is also because frying means cooking the food
equally from all the parts. That is why you need to leave enough room for food to cook in the fryer.
