THE ULTIMATE CROWN OF NEPALI CUISINE.


It's pretty obvious to love your county's cuisine despite the fact that foreign cuisine seems tempting af. My country is known for
the variety of culture and people, it's beauty, mountains, wildlife and lakes and so much more but people might rarely say
any names if you ask them about our cuisine. They might have a few names to say, but you would definitely not hear about kheer.
And who would make the best out of all Nepali cuisines except for the locals that eat them regularly.

As far as I know, kheer was discovered by farmers, who would be eating it to celebrate successful harvest. This totally sweet and
delicious dish took only a short period of time to get it's place on every Nepalis heart. It's usually eaten in the month of June and July
where the farmers harvest the rice and entire Nepalese home makes Kheer to celebrate. But that's not only the custom we have here. 
To mark successful harvest in this period, this sweet rice pudding, is made as a Prasad in the name of god and eat it themselves. 
And today, it has been a custom to definitely cook this at least once in the month of June and July to respect the entire farmer family.

This dish particularly isn't a difficult one to make but does requires a lot of patience and love. Your'e basically at
the right spot to find out what it takes to make one delicious bowl of Kheer. Hope you gather 
all the ingredients as soon as possible into your kitchen, indulge into it and treat your loved ones with its.
