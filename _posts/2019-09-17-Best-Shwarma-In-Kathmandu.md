It's actually been a month or two where I have indulged myself into blogging and I realize that I love to write. Just not write 
but to express every single thing that outstands me, be it the foods, travel, my perspectives or the recipes I try to cook.
It simply feels good to connect with my readers through my writing.

And ever since I have started blogging, every single thing I do makes me do it "bloggable". Therefore, this time I decided
to go hunt the famous middle east food called the <mark class="text-primary">'shwarma roll'</mark> in the alleys of Thamel. My love for rolls initially started with 
a huge influence from someone I heart very much. He is basically heads over heels for rolls and my quest of surprising him 
with a unique middle east flavour bought me to the place called Thamel Doner Kebab. The last I remember, they have amazing 
variety of stuffs you can make a roll out of which includes the doner kebab obviously, shwarma rolls and falafel rolls. 

There are several take away shops in Kathmandu that offers you rolls but then we do not have any authentic Nepali rolls with Nepali
favours. It's either the Calcutta's famous katti rolls or the rolls of Syanko. And to be honest, wraps are famous all over the 
world, specially the wraps of Arab Cuisine. 

We had been informed about this place recently by a food vlogger who had visited to try the authentic shwarma and falafel rolls in Kathmandu
at Thamel and we were extremely intimidated by the way she portrayed the food. You also would want to eat it if you watch the video.
And that is how a friend of mine and I decided to kick our scooters off to that place.

<h2 class="text-primary">Where is it exactly?</h2>   
To be honest we also had a tough time finding the place merely because both of us do not carry a smartphone and were unable to
find the place through maps. The only thing we knew was that it's right beside Kathmandu Grand Hotel. And hence, we called 
a friend of ours to find us the exact location. 

For you people who has smartphone however can just google the [location](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Thamel+Doner+Kebab/@27.7175251,85.3083662,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x39eb18e33066c6f1:0x6eebff496238d965!8m2!3d27.7174402!4d85.3102514).

Once you get to Thamel, head straight to Kalapathar. On kalapathar, you'll find a junction that goes either left or right.
The road we should be taking is the right one. Head straight for about five minutes and keep on mind the "hotel's name" (that's
what we did). Once you find the Kathmandu Grand Hotel, the doner kebab shop is right beside it.

<h2 class="text-primary">What did we order?</h2>

The menu there was a page long with so many items we had never heard our entire life, but we did knew that pieces of meat
and fats were stacked over a rod which was slowly cooked in a circular motion with consistent heat coming from a heater and it was
called the shwarma meat. Veggies, cheese, shwarma meat and their authentic sauce was kept in a flat bread and rolled to form
a shwarma roll. And that is what we ordered. Any one who would want their roll to be gluten free could also order flat bread made
up of wheat. The roll is slightly grilled to give the smokey flavour. Served with chilly sauce, normal tomato ketchup and veggies
dipped in vinegar, I genuinely felt that this one is probably the finest shwarma roll we can find in Kathmandu.
