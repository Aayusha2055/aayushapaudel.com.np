This gajar ko haluwa is a dessert made with lots of carrot and lots of milk and a quite bit of sugar and it's absolutely 
amazing.

Trust me when I say this, you are sure to have extreme sugar cravings during the weight loss phase. I have been there and had it 
and understood how difficult it is to cope up with it and what choices we make for our sweet tooth. On this phase, one thing
I always wondered was how to utilize low calorie foods for dealing with such stuffs. And then the internet that suggests you to
eat fruits and greek yogurts and dark chocolates but that's pretty much something that you do not want to.

The latter was my inspiration of creating the gajar ko haluwa in true Nepalish way. I think they're amazing and a nice alternative
to our sweet tooth. Beautiful both inside out, tasty and not hard to make at all, I have outlined the detailed steps in the
tutorial that follows.

Make sure to try this out and have fun while cooking!!

 
  
<div class="recipe-contents">
 <div class="ingredients">
   <h2 class="text-primary">Ingredients</h2> 
     <ul>
       <li>1 kgs of Carrot</li>
       <li>1 litre milk</li>
       <li>1 large tablespoon of ghee </li>
       <li>50gms of Oarsman (Khuwa) </li>
       <li>Half tablespoon cinnamon powder</li>
       <li>100ml condensed milk</li>
       <li>5 tablespoon of sugar</li>
       <li>12-15 cardamons</li>
     </ul>
 </div>
          
 <div class="directions">
   <h2 class="text-primary">Directions</h2> 
     <ol>
       <li>Wash the carrot properly and peel them. Once you do it grate it nice and small.</li>
       <li>Heat a pan and add the ghee in it. Once the ghee starts getting hot, add the grated carrot into it.
       Once the carrot starts heating, it releases the juice in it. We need to cook the carrot completely, until it sucks 
       all of its water.</li>
       <li>Another alternative to doing the previous step would be to cook the carrots in the pressure cooker
        until two full hissing sound. Once it's done you can then add the carrots into the pan and fry it with ghee. This
        way you'll get your work done a lot faster.</li>
       <li>Pour one whole litre of milk in the carrots. Take another pan and melt the khuwa. Also add the melted khuwa in the
       mixture.</li>
       <li>If you like chewing cardamons then you might not want to powder it. But I personally would suggest you to add 
       5 pieces as it is and the rest of them to be made into powder and add them.</li>
       <li>Add sugar and cinnamon powder into the mixture and cook it in small flame till you see that the milk level has 
       risen down and started to get thicker.</li>
       <li>Garnish with any dry fruits you love and enjoy the haluwa warm or cool down further to eat it as a dessert.</li>
     </ol>
