WE LOVE KATHMANDU.

Despite of polluted areas and chaos of the place, it has its own local cuisine with beautiful aspects and a strong grip in the taste of food which has won our hearts . 
And it is very important that you know, where to eat and what to eat.
People involved in satisfying customers with their food try their best to deliver a good taste to the tongue as they are the taste makers. And when
it comes to locals presenting their food in the market, undeniably, they're the best.

People do like to find places with amazing ambiance and food to chill and eat, but are most often busy and short
of money. So they want foods that are fast and tastes delicious. Often they follow their friend's recommendation
or food instagrammers but their recommendation can have significant sway over you and where you have your next meal.

Here are some top local eateries around Kathmandu that you might want to try out if you're around that street.

<h2 class="text-primary">Khyarloom's Momo</h2> 
Any Nepali that doubts in momos , are either not Nepali, or  have never tried momos.  Nepalese people
want momos any season in any weather. And Khyarloom's momo has undoubtedly been able to please their customers since the past 40 years.
Run by locals in the streets of Sukedhara, their momo and their peanut sauce is a match made in heaven. The size of the momo
is big enough for your tummy to be full with eight to ten pieces. Every item you eat costs you at most of 120Rs, with enough
serving size.


 > <h4 class="text-primary">Location</h4> 
 > After you get to Sukedhara Chowk, take the alley beside the Traffic office. A minute of walk leads you to 
 > Laxmi Bank Chowk. Take right until you reach a three way junction. Take left from the junction and you will find Global Cafe
 > to your left. On your right, a bit ahead of Global cafe, is where Khyarloom is located.

<h2 class="text-primary">R.S Chinese Food, Naxal</h2> 
The name might give you a hint about eating typical chinese food, but chinese food in local terms
means eating delicious fast food. R.S Chinese Food at Naxal offers you varieties of fast food starting from fried sausage,
mushroom, tofu, drumstick, meat ball or fresh steamed momos, fried rice, nepali stir fried noodles, burgers and many more
all served with their inhouse special sauce at amazing price with amazing quantity. It is very cheap and tasty at
the same time.


 > <h4 class="text-primary">Location</h4> 
 > After you reach to Naxal Bhagwati Temple, take the road towards Naxal. This place is about two stores away from the temple.

<h2 class="text-primary">Halal, Dhobidhara Marg </h2> 
Halal is another local eateries in Kathmandu, that serves you delicious biryani at the cheapest rate. There are several other places that
serves you authentic biryani as well, but they are extremely expensive. And that's how hunting a place that serves authentic
biryani was important to me. When I finally found the place, I was excited to try my taste. 
They serve a plate for 200Rs only. The spices in their biryani is rich.The sad part is that because the preparation takes time, they only serve
it on Sundays, Tuesdays and Fridays. Personally, for a biryani lover like me, it’s a win win.

 > <h4 class="text-primary">Location</h4> 
 > This place lies in between the alley beside City Center towards Putalisadak.
 > Take the alley beside City Center towards QFX Kumari. About 500 meters ahead, to your right, you will find this shop, which looks
 > like a tea shop that has a hoarding board written halal in it. Make sure, you carefully walk the whole way and not miss it. You can even ask the locals around if you get confused.

<h2 class="text-primary">Syanko's Katti Roll</h2> 
Syanko's Katti Roll can now be phrased as the "national katti roll", as their outlet are quite spread all over the valley now, serving us delicious rolls since the past fifteen years. My personal one around Kathmandu lies at two places, one at Sinamangal, which not only offers you delicious
rolls, but also has variety of other fast foods and the other one lies at Baneshwor, whose menu is limited to rolls only. These are the
oldest Syanko's Rolls at Kathmandu. You should definitely try their double egg double chicken roll. You'll love it.


 > <h4 class="text-primary">Location</h4> 
 > Syanko's Rolls are scattered in various places. You can find the store nearby you easily in the maps.

<h2 class="text-primary">Khawa Kharpo Noodles Factory, Fulbari, Bouddha</h2>
If you happen to be around Bouddha, noodles of Khawa Kharpo is a must try. The shop lies at about five minutes walk from
the stupa and serves you the best plate of noodles you'll ever eat. Like the name itself says "factory”,  the noodles are their in-house
production. They produce the noodles, cook it and serve you fresh right in front of your eyes. It generally opens up after 11 A.M so make
sure you don't go there for breakfast. White boiled noodles, served with fresh Chinese Spinach with the choice of your toppings(buff or egg)
and their sauce is actually a treat to your taste buds. They also serve another Tibetan dish named “Laphing”, which also is worth a try.

 > <h4 class="text-primary">Location</h4> 
 > After you get into the gates of Bouddha, make a round from your left until you find an alley. Take that alley, and go straight.
 > You will soon find out series of laphing joints. After you pass onto chatterbox laphing, you will find the shop in your left.

<h2 class="text-primary">TIP TOP Samosa Pasal, Swachapu Marga</h2>
Tip top has undoubtedly been able to win hearts of Nepalese with their samosas and variety of other indian sweets and foods. The reason why
there's this huge crowd at every outlet of Tip Top is because of their samosas. Samosa is simply mashed potatoes with spices stuffed inside
a flat dough, made into a triangle and deep fried. A piece of samosa at tip top costs you twenty five rupees only and two would
be enough for a hungry stomach. They serve it with their house sauce that's tangy and sweet at the same time. The samosa goes really
well with the sweet-tangy sauce.

 > <h4 class="text-primary">Location</h4> 
 > Tip Top Sweets at Kathmandu is located in several places. There are a total of four outlets in the valley and three of them lies in Kathmandu
 > whereas the other one lies in Lalitpur.
 > The authentic samosa pasal of Tip Top however is situated on the road from Bishal Bazar to Indrachowk.

<h2 class="text-primary">NPP Fast Food, Newroad</h2>
Any fast food lover in Nepal loves what NPP has to offer and specially its their in house sauce that has won hearts ever since.
People here basically love NPP and the variety of stick foods along with their momo. NPP Food Service also has successfully been
able to open various outlets in the valley. You should definitely try out their sausage, potato sticks, tofu and momo if you ever happen
to be there. Another recommendation would be to have their c-momo which is a win win too.

 > <h4 class="text-primary">Location</h4> 
 > When you reach to Bishal Bazar at New Road, take your left until you reach a junction. About five minutes walk and you'll find this amazing food joint

<h2 class="text-primary">Jhigu Che, Ganeshthan</h2>
Jhigu che by far is my top favourite Newari food joints around Kathmandu. Located in the heart of Chabahil, this place
serves you authentic Newari cuisine with best of flavours. A family run local shop has a limited items in their menu but they have
been able to take their creativity to a different level by inventing water momo. Water momo is basically momo made by 
boiling in the water. When we asked how was it possible, the chef explained that it took him almost six months to finally success
into making water boiled momos. They have the tastiest veg choila i.e. soyabean served with mixed spices. This place
is definitely a must visit place if you are around Chabahil.

 > <h4 class="text-primary">Location</h4> 
 > If you are at Chabhil chowk then take the alley towards Ganeshthan Temple. About 500 meters straight towards Mitrapark into the alley and
 > you'll find this place on your left.

<h2 class="text-primary">Burger Freak, Freak Street</h2>
Burgers are my personal favourite and when this place flooded into food blogger's instagram I had to try it. On visiting the shop, I
was quite amazed to find out the price they had set for every burgers. Trying their special burger is by far the best food
that has ever happened to me. All the burgers range upto 250Rs which is totally satisfying as you are served delicious burger 
with enough fillings. If you ever happen to be around Freak Street, DO NOT MISS this burger.

 > <h4 class="text-primary">Location</h4> 
 > When you reach freak street, a bit ahead of Palpasa Cafe, you will find an alley that goes to Snowman cafe. Burger Freak
 > is about a hundred meters away from snowman's cafe.

<h2 class="text-primary">Snowman Cafe, Freak Street</h2>
Snowman cafe is one of the oldest cafe of freak street. They have been able to win hearts of their customers since the past
50 years, and literally everyone knows about this place. This is one of those places which has amazing memory of every college 
students. People go here for their cakes and coffees and they are delicious and affordable at the same time. Snowman's cafe now has a vintage touch since 
the interior hasn't been changed or renovated. 

 > <h4 class="text-primary">Location</h4> 
 > There's a small alley that connects freak street to Newroad. Just take the alley and the cafe lies two house away.

<h2 class="text-primary">Grill Durbar, Sankhamul</h2>
If you ever crave for a big piece of grilled meat,  grill durbar, without a doubt the is the ultimate saviour. Grill durbar
has a variety on the grills starting from normal to extremely spicy. It is loaded with flavours and the spicy sauce
they serve along is to die for. With very reasonable price, though this place doesn't seem to be a local one,
it is a small shop with large packets of flavours.


 > <h4 class="text-primary">Location</h4> 
 > From Baneshowr Chowk, you got to take the road to Sankhamul. You have to go downhill untill you find a turning. Grill durbar is
 > right at your left when you take the turning to the left.
