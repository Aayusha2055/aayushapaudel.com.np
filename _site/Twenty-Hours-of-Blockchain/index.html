    "body": "2019/09/06 - This gajar ko haluwa is a dessert made with lots of carrot and lots of milk and a quite bit of sugar and it’s absolutely amazing. Trust me when I say this, you are sure to have extreme sugar cravings during the weight loss phase. I have been there and had it and understood how difficult it is to cope up with it and what choices we make for our sweet tooth. On this phase, one thingI always wondered was how to utilize low calorie foods for dealing with such stuffs. And then the internet that suggests you toeat fruits and greek yogurts and dark chocolates but that’s pretty much something that you do not want to. The latter was my inspiration of creating the gajar ko haluwa in true Nepalish way. I think they’re amazing and a nice alternativeto our sweet tooth. Beautiful both inside out, tasty and not hard to make at all, I have outlined the detailed steps in thetutorial that follows. Make sure to try this out and have fun while cooking!!   Ingredients:       1 kgs of Carrot    1 litre milk    1 large tablespoon of ghee    50gms of Oarsman (Khuwa)    Half tablespoon cinnamon powder    100ml condensed milk    5 tablespoon of sugar    12-15 cardamons          Directions:       Wash the carrot properly and peel them. Once you do it grate it nice and small.    Heat a pan and add the ghee in it. Once the ghee starts getting hot, add the grated carrot into it.    Once the carrot starts heating, it releases the juice in it. We need to cook the carrot completely, until it sucks    all of its water.    Another alternative to doing the previous step would be to cook the carrots in the pressure cooker    until two full hissing sound. Once it's done you can then add the carrots into the pan and fry it with ghee. This    way you'll get your work done a lot faster.    Pour one whole litre of milk in the carrots. Take another pan and melt the khuwa. Also add the melted khuwa in the    mixture.    If you like chewing cardamons then you might not want to powder it. But I personally would suggest you to add    5 pieces as it is and the rest of them to be made into powder and add them.    Add sugar and cinnamon powder into the mixture and cook it in small flame till you see that the milk level has    risen down and started to get thicker.    Garnish with any dry fruits you love and enjoy the haluwa warm or cool down further to eat it as a dessert.     If you did try making this at home, drop a comment below and share about how it ended up. And would also love to hear you’re horror cooking stories. You tell yours and i’ll tell you mine. "

    "title": "Air Frying Chicken | Home Cooking",
    "body": "2019/08/25 - Interestingly, things turn out great without oil as well. Past two months of my life has turned complete upside down as I had a sudden urge to loose weight. Things would have been pretty normal if I was slightly overweight but I was obese for my height and age. I stand about 4. 11 from the ground and would weight almost 132. 2 where according to the calculations, I should be no more than 112. 4lbs. That’s when getting in shapebecame important to me. I joined the gym, started working out about two hours a day and ate in calorie deficit. I repeated the samepattern of foods for breakfast, lunch and dinner. On most of the days, I would even avoid dinners. Following the same boring food patternwas difficult and I would crave for things I used to hate. I wanted to eat amazing chicken, deep fried momos with hot sauce,and all those things that would not allow me to loose weight. For your information, Nepali cuisines need a lot of oil as well. That’s where things get rough. Right at this time, my uncle came with Air Fryer to visit us. He brought it from China and wanted us to try it out. Initially,I had no idea what it would do but later I can state that it “changed my life”. I’ve prepared hundreds of food and the same foodhundred times and I eat them all guilt free. Getting in shape has turned my mindset into counting calories and air fryerhas successfully been able to remove that extra 110 calories from my plate. If you’ve got a air fryer too then why not indulge in my recipes then. This time I will be writing about making delicious soft and tender chicken with air fryer. If you want it to be extremely juicy you can add the oil. As far as I do this, Iavoid the oil. In Nepal, the completely dried meat is also called chicken sekuwa. Let’s get started then! Ingredients:  Chicken with bones (1 kgs) Curd (One small cup) Salt (1 and half teaspoon) Turmeric (1 teaspoon) Red Chilly Powder (1 teaspoon) Nepali Chilly (Akabare) Paste (1 teaspoon) Jeera Seed (Half teaspoon) Carom Seed (Half teaspoon) 2-3 Cardamons Coriander Mint Two Onions Half a garlic Half a gingerEquipments:  Air Fryer Blender Saucepan BowlDirections:  Chop the onion into small pieces and keep then inside the air fryer for about 5 minutes in 180 degree. While the onion keeps on getting caramelized, heat a saucepan to roast cardamons, jeera seed and carom seed. You can roast themfor about 2 to 3 minutes.  When both the onions and the seeds are done, turn them into the blender. Slice the ginger and garlic into small pieces and add them into the blender. Add mint, coriander, salt, turmeric, chilly powder, paste and curd into the blender and blend tall of these ingredients into a smooth paste.  Take the chicken into a big bowl and add the paste to it. Mix it well and leave the chicken for minimum two hours. Igenerally like to marinate my meat overnight, but you can do it as much as you like.  When you start being impatient about the chicken that’s when you’ll know it’s ready to get inside the fryer. Gently placethe chicken into the fryer. Do not overload. Add only if the counter space is free.  You can do it first for 5 minutes in about 180 to 190 degree. Come back, shake it well, turn the pieces upside downand keep it back again for another 5 minutes. Voila! You’ll get somewhat grilled and somewhat fried chicken two in one atthe same time. Things to be Cautious About: Chicken: A lot of air frying recipes of chicken would want you to cook it without marination but this Nepali style chicken goes completelyfine inside the air fryer. Keep Shaking it like a boss: Shaking the fryer would allow everything inside it to move and allow the hot air to circulate to every surface of each food. I recommend you do it more often like in between every five minutes. Do not overload: As small as the counter is, that’s how small portion we should be keeping inside it. You would definitely not be staking foodsone after another in your usual pan or even in the over and that goes same with the fryer. Fryers do come with racks these days, but you shouldn’t overload it anyways. This is also because frying means cooking the foodequally from all the parts. That is why you need to leave enough room for food to cook in the fryer. A note from the author "

    "title": "My Week in a Nutshell | August 2019 ",
    "body": "2019/08/23 - It’s pretty hard to justify what it is like to be busy as a student when the world assumes you’re not. A student also hasequally busy day, as any other 9 to 5 workers or a house wife or any other people who earn for a living. This busy city lifedefinitely bores your soul and makes it wonder why you’re even living. In the midst of pollution and population, there are so manythings that you miss to reckon. Things that may have power to move your soul, or the things that could bring a smile to your face. To be honest, my morning starts at 5 with a cup of hot lemon with ginger honey. Next thing, I rush out from home to catch a 5:45 busto my college. Half the time, i’m asleep on the bus, and most of the time in class. Upon reaching home, I take a nap, go to the gymand prepare myself for the next day nonchalantly. And if you’re day looks like this, perhaps you forget that there is a world outside,which can give you enough reasons to feel that the life you’re living might not be that bad as it seems. And so, last Saturdayit clicked in my mind to note those many-few small-big things that made me smile. Today, I bring you a blog based on it. Mind you, I am extremely sensitive, so even you if you bring me a cup of water, I might cry. On the streets of Basantapur: While strolling on the streets of Basantapur, a lot of kids try to convince you to buy a bottle of water from them. I was also a part oftheir small initiative to sell the water. Two kids randomly came to me and offered me to buy one. I on the other hand alwayscarry a bottle of water with me. So instead I convinced them that I carry my own bottle. But because they are kids, they kept nagging. It was quite difficult to escape them as well, one because they were super cute and two, they were kids. Next thing I did was asked if they were thirsty. They denied at first but later accepted that they were. I offered them the water I had. They drank it like they were thirsty for a while. When I asked if their thirst was quenched, they happily said yes. After a little chat with them, I remembered I had peanut butter cookies ordered and received from Pokhara that morning. I gave them the cookies , they grabbed them all. And why not! They may not have eaten good since who knows how long. They took a bite and I waited for their reaction. I still remember their face when they found it to be really good. It still makes me smile every time I think of it. Today, while writing this, I hope they are having a good time and getting the opportunity to go to school everyday. Crossing the busy street at Mitrapark: Lack of self awareness has changed the way of Traffic in Kathmandu. If there aren’t any traffic police in every junction, thenthere obviously is a hassle of vehicles and pedestrians. In situations as such, I definitely have a hard time crossing roads every single time. Monday was something similar. I was trying to cross one of the busiest streets of Mitrapark. Few others were easily crossing it. Easilymight not be the appropriate word but for an agyrophobic, they made it look simple. I kept struggling for a while when a man around his sixties came to me and asked if I was scared. I was definitely scared but couldn’t admit it properly. Out of nowhere, he asked me if I have watched the classic Bollywood blockbuster Sholay and if I remember a dialogue of Mr. Amitabh Bachhan. I had watched the movie time and again but was confused on which dialogue he wasspecifically talking about. He reminded me as he went on saying it, “JO DAR GAYA SAMJHO MAR GAYA”. Which if translated to english is if you’re scared, you’re dead. He acquainted me to the other side of the road and asked me to brave. I hope he is happily living in his sixties. I wish him good health. Struggling with period pain: When I think about periods, and that women have an average of 450 periods in their lifetime, I feel really proud of women all aroundthe globe. Cramps, back pain, mood swings, “never-quick-enough” painkillers, hot water bags and hot showers arequite on demand and exercise and social plans are off the hook. It’s basically thattime of the month where you pretend to be okay but on the inside, your’e dying. Sometimes, my pain are the worst ones. In most of the cases they are. You could even say it a coincidence, but there’s one person in my life, who by the grace of god, has always taken care of me when I feel like ending my world. That person has stood in the scorching heat with me when I was looking for warmth in some 29 degree celsius, always managed to rush to the drug store to get me medicines, and come back with snacks. To that someone, who held me when I fainted multiple times, who brought me hot waters and medicines and snacks that I love,and who made sure I ate, I hope I can always pay it forward whenever I get the chance to. Also, I wish good luck, prosperity and a loyal life partner. Deciding to be decisive: There’s this weird practice of Nepalese people of believing in astrology and following astrologer’s suggestions. That’s howlast week I also ended up with a so called Astrologer that scans the fingerprints of each finger and prepares a 40 pagedocumentation on things I have been carrying since birth. The so called astrologer is a specialist of Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP). If you are new to this then NLP is a scientific approach to communication, personal development and psychotherapy. When my official report arrived and I had a private counsellingsession, I was told that I have a higher gross motor skills and that is why I cannot say NO to anyone and anything. Also, because ofit I am a confused person and cannot take any decisions because higher the gross motor skills, the more the thoughts are processed whichmakes decision making a tough job. I had a bit of a chat with one of my closest friends about this and what he had to say was, I can completely understand you because a part of me knows you better than anything but also because I am somewhat like you. And that’s where he told me thatboth of us will work on ourselves and that I will never have to feel alone when struggling on a daily basis. When I retaliate what he said to me, I think I am very blessed to have someone like him in my life. And also, if he was the oneto share, I might not be able to tell him that both of us will work on it. I hope I can always be available to him whenever he needsa helping hand. "

    "body": "2019/08/14 - BAKING AT HOME INDEED IS A PLEASURE. My dear foodies, I know you have landed on this page after randomly scrolling on several pages,trying to find that one thing which might actually catch your guards off. Having a healthy diet but also the fact that your sweet tooth wants something pleasing as well as interesting at the same time. It’s probably weekend and now you prefer your bed more than anything in the world so you decide not to go out. And this is how you wonder if baking is what you want to do. Be it the ingredients, equipments or the time, something always has been stopping you from taking a lead, but not anymore. Today, I present you a recipe that you’ll probably would stick for your entire life. This recipe involves making a bread which is indeed an art of cooking, not everyone can master at. Every baker has at least ten thousand stories to tell until they make a perfect slice of bread. I do have my own share of stories. The rest is history! So my friend, if you’ve ever thought of making your piece of bread at home, let’s indulge in this recipe. I might have forgotten to mention about banana being the king here, but never mind, let’s make a banana bread today. Another interesting thing you might find here is that I do not have an oven at home. Instead it’s the microwave.  Baking in the microwave is very tricky as one minute you’ll have the best bread ever, and the other, you’ll have it all burned. You really need to be cautious about what’s going on inside the oven. I have come up with this recipe after failing numerous times. Sometimes, the batter would get runny, the other times Iwould overcook it. Because I do not have an oven and need to use a microwave, it always used to be frustrating when I would try to make it the best andit would turn out to be inedible. Make sure you bake it with love. That way, you can finally get aperfect piece of food to eat and enjoy.   Ingredients:       1 cup unsalted butter    A cup of all purpose flour    A cup of whole wheat flour    Three completely ripe bananas    1 teaspoon salt    1/2 teaspoon baking soda    1/2 teaspoon baking powder    3 tablespoon sugar    2 teaspoons of lemon zest    A teaspoon of vanilla extract    2 eggs    Two teaspoon cinnamon powder    Three teaspoon honey          Directions:       Butter a medium Bundt pan. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, salt, cinnamon powder, baking soda, and baking powder.    Mash the bananas using a fork. You can make a runny paste out of it or keep the chunks.    Using an electric mixer, beat the butter, sugar, honey and lemon zest on medium-high until light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Beat in the mashed bananas, then the eggs, one at a time, scraping down sides of bowl as necessary.    Reduce mixer speed to low. Add half the flour mixture, and then the remaining flour mixture. Mix just until combined (do not overmix).    Transfer the batter to the prepared pans and microwave until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Keep checking the batter in every 10 minutes interval. Cool the bread in the pan for 25 minutes, then turn it out onto a wire rack to cool    Enjoy the bread with your favourite drink.          If you tried making this at home, drop a comment below and share about how it ended up. Do not worry if you’re just a beginner. Failing teaches you how to master it the next time. Also, would love to hear your horror baking stories. Even if the bread turned out inedible. The first time I tried this, I burned half the bread. So it’s alright. You’ll have it even better than most famous shops one day. And if possible, we might even open a shop together. What do you say?    "

    "body": "2019/08/14 - WE LOVE KATHMANDU. Despite of polluted areas and chaos of the place, it has its own local cuisine with beautiful aspects and a strong grip in the taste of food which has won our hearts . And it is very important that you know, where to eat and what to eat. People involved in satisfying customers with their food try their best to deliver a good taste to the tongue as they are the taste makers. And whenit comes to locals presenting their food in the market, undeniably, they’re the best. People do like to find places with amazing ambiance and food to chill and eat, but are most often busy and shortof money. So they want foods that are fast and tastes delicious. Often they follow their friend’s recommendationor food instagrammers but their recommendation can have significant sway over you and where you have your next meal. Here are some top local eateries around Kathmandu that you might want to try out if you’re around that street. Khyarloom's Momo: Any Nepali that doubts in momos , are either not Nepali, or have never tried momos.  Nepalese peoplewant momos any season in any weather. And Khyarloom’s momo has undoubtedly been able to please their customers since the past 40 years. Run by locals in the streets of Sukedhara, their momo and their peanut sauce is a match made in heaven. The size of the momois big enough for your tummy to be full with eight to ten pieces. Every item you eat costs you at most of 120Rs, with enoughserving size.  Location:  After you get to Sukedhara Chowk, take the alley beside the Traffic office.

S Chinese Food, Naxal: The name might give you a hint about eating typical chinese food, but chinese food in local termsmeans eating delicious fast food. R. S Chinese Food at Naxal offers you varieties of fast food starting from fried sausage,mushroom, tofu, drumstick, meat ball or fresh steamed momos, fried rice, nepali stir fried noodles, burgers and many moreall served with their inhouse special sauce at amazing price with amazing quantity.

There are several other places thatserves you authentic biryani as well, but they are extremely expensive. And that’s how hunting a place that serves authenticbiryani was important to me. When I finally found the place, I was excited to try my taste. They serve a plate for 200Rs only. The spices in their biryani is rich. The sad part is that because the preparation takes time, they only serveit on Sundays, Tuesdays and Fridays. Personally, for a biryani lover like me, it’s a win win.  Location:  This place lies in between the alley beside City Center towards Putalisadak. Take the alley beside City Center towards QFX Kumari. About 500 meters ahead, to your right, you will find this shop, which lookslike a tea shop that has a hoarding board written halal in it. Make sure, you carefully walk the whole way and not miss it.

Syanko's Katti Roll: Syanko’s Katti Roll can now be phrased as the “national katti roll”, as their outlet are quite spread all over the valley now, serving us delicious rolls since the past fifteen years. My personal one around Kathmandu lies at two places, one at Sinamangal, which not only offers you deliciousrolls, but also has variety of other fast foods and the other one lies at Baneshwor, whose menu is limited to rolls only. These are theoldest Syanko’s Rolls at Kathmandu. You should definitely try their double egg double chicken roll. You’ll love it.  Location:  Syanko’s Rolls are scattered in various places.

They produce the noodles, cook it and serve you fresh right in front of your eyes. It generally opens up after 11 A. M so makesure you don’t go there for breakfast.

TIP TOP Samosa Pasal, Swachapu Marga: Tip top has undoubtedly been able to win hearts of Nepalese with their samosas and variety of other indian sweets and foods. The reason whythere’s this huge crowd at every outlet of Tip Top is because of their samosas. Samosa is simply mashed potatoes with spices stuffed insidea flat dough, made into a triangle and deep fried. A piece of samosa at tip top costs you twenty five rupees only and two wouldbe enough for a hungry stomach. They serve it with their house sauce that’s tangy and sweet at the same time.

A family run local shop has a limited items in their menu but they havebeen able to take their creativity to a different level by inventing water momo.

    "title": "Rara Lake Tour | Travel Blog",
    "body": "2019/08/10 - GUIDING YOU TO HEAVEN. A group of eight friends, some who knew each other very well, while some who had no idea who the rest of them would be, abruptly decided to go on a trip to the far western land of Nepal. Travelling usually takes a lot of patience, specially when the place you’re about to go has difficult roads, difficult transportation facilities and the most important one: when you’re budget travelling. Travelling far away with friends as we scramble in the roads, it honestly is a unifying bond that doesn’t discriminate or judge. Packed up and ready from the bus park in Kathmandu, we headed towards Amilia, Dang where a friend of ours awaited with a reserved jeep. The bus took off at seven in the evening and so did our adrenalin. With lots of stories to share, and extreme junk food packages, the road trip to Amilia ended in a blink of an eye. Travelling allows you to enjoy to the fullest, warms the depth of your soul and always leaves you curious with what the next minute has to offer. And that’s what we were, young and curious. The place we were headed was one of the best place Nepal has to offer to you. The place beyond the beautiful horizon and something that was phrased as, “Heaven is a myth. Rara is real”. When I think of it now, I feel as if my journey is a dream that fillsthe root of my heart and gives me the feeling of accomplishment. Rara lake is the biggest freshwater lake in Nepal. Situated in a small district of Nepal, Mugu, surrounded by hills all around at an altitude of 2990m is one of the must visit place in Nepal. Often times people assume that you got to trek to reach there,but we have several other ways to explore western Nepal and the lake itself.  Ways To Travel: Airways:  Take a flight from Kathmandu to Nepalgunj and from Nepalgunj to Talcha Airport. Rara lake is four hour hike away from Talcha airport.  You can also take a flight from Nepalgunj to Jumla. From Jumla you need to either take a bus or jeep to Gamagadhi. Gamagadhi is the district headquarters of Mugu. The lake is five hours hike from Gamagadhi. Roadways:    Take a bus to Surkhet or Nepalgunj. You can get a bus to Kalikot which would be a whole day drive. From Kalikot, you got to switch bus to Nagma and from Nagma another bus that leads to Gamagadhi. As mentioned earlier, the lake is five hours hike from Gamagadhi. The bus travels along the famous Karnali Highway.     The second and the most flexible and comfortable way would be to reserve a jeep. You do not necessarily need to reserve it from the place you live in. We travelled to Dang by bus and reserved a jeep there for five days which cost us around forty five thousand Nepali Rupees for eight people.  Trek: Rara lies in the Karnali region that has amazing landscapes and experience the authentic western past of Nepal from food to people. You can find several options in the internet if you look for Khaptak trek that en routes Rara Lake. Travel Like We Did: Day 1: First day of our travel actually started at 7pm in the evening, in the night bus, with friends on the highway to Western Nepal. I personally knew everyone of them, but yes, there were people who hadn’t met each other their entire life. To be honest, travelling with strangers lets you leave your shit behind and focus only on the wonderful stories to talk about. The challenge this time was not only to explore a different environment but also new people and let your guards down. Like mentioned earlier we took a bus from Kathmandu upto Amilia, Dang where a friend of ours was waiting with a reserved jeep and started our road trip. One of the best part of tripping around west is the fields on Terai, the vibes Bardiya National Park gives in between and the variety of animals you spot in between. We had our lunch in Kohalpur and headed towards Surkhet. And would you even call it a road trip if your tire doesn’t get punctured at least once? Plannings beforehand did let us know that our destination for the day was Manma,but because punctured tire took time, we started late and reached to Rakham that night. Accomodation at Rakam: You can pretty much expect good accommodation upto Surkhet but after that you meet people who might even sleep at the floor but give you their bed. Sometimes, it’s the materialistic things people want, but when someone would sacrifice their comfort for yours, that’s when you know, you’ve met a good soul. People there do not have much to offer except for what they have and that honestly stands out. At Rakham, you do not find big hotels but you can find enough home with bigger hearts. The one we stayed had a family of five who made us delicious Nepali Thali, with a taste of Karnali, cooked in fire with love. When we asked what they would cost for a night, they said we only need to pay for the food and pay what we feel like for the accommodation. We then paid three thousand rupees to the family of the home stay and they gave us warm farewell full of blessings and good luck. Day 2: Second day started with much excitement than the previous one because the lake awaited us more than anything. Reaching Manma the first day would have made our schedule up to time, but when they say whatever happens, happens for best, they are true. Our next stop for lunch was Nagma. The road to Nagma wasn’t that sophisticated but people we were with taught us to live in the moment and enjoy it. As the roads started getting complex,friends started getting simpler. And when we finally rested our butts out of the jeep in Nagma, the view we had in front of us was amazing. The barren hills, the over speed flow of river, the sound the water flow was making, at most 10 houses attached with one other, and people with rough red cheeks did let us realize that people do live in such places which had nothing yet everything. The river that flows had the purest freshwater. The views, the bridges and small architect in them that signifies Kings and Queens were worth the watch. Since we were half day late according to the schedule we had made, so after filling our tummy with yummy food at Nagma we decided that we will not be stopping any way until we reach to our destination. At about 6 in the evening we finally entered the Khaptad National Park region where we were suggested not to go further and rather spend the night somewherenearby but because we were so determined to see the lake before our eyes first thing in the morning we didn’t stop. At 9:30 pm we reached to Salleri, from where the road ends, and travellers have to hike. The locals there suggested us to stay rather than to hike at night, but our young blood, fueled hormones didn’t let us stop. So finally, in the cold windy shivering weather of Rara, we decided to walk up until we reach to our hotel. I tell you, the hike was worth the effort we had madeuntil then, worth the equation everyone shares today, and worth the bond that got stronger. When we finally reached our hotel at about past midnight, we were warmly welcomed with hot waters and fresh food. We got our tents and finally slept not knowing what the day after had to offer us. Day 3: Since waking up to the lake was what everyone of us had in our mind, early morning at Rara had a surprise for us. It snowed for the first time that year, and the view was worth the travel. Google pictures of Rara always had few of them covered with snow, but to see it right in front of your eyes, the process, where slowly all the greens turn into white withing a short span of time is breathtaking. The only thing that was disturbing was the unconditional cold that wasn’t going anywhere until the sun showed up. And no matter how much you want the snow, you’ll eventually crave for the sun. The only way to beat the cold weather was to hike around the biggest freshwater lake and few minutes later, the beauty of lake warms you up naturally. We were served delicious breakfast that morning, that had roasted potatoes, omelet, typical nepali chapatis of buckwheat and a warm cup of tea. We spent the rest of the day, in front of the lake, admiring its beauty. Few friends of mine, further hiked to Murma Top, which is said to be the view-point of Rara. Day 4: After having our breakfast the morose thought of leaving this place hit me I did not want to leave. But like the old saying goes, “All good things must come to an end”, it was time to bid farewell to this beautiful place. However, Rara decided to give us a warm and sunny goodbye. As we sail our boat on the lake the sun and the lake sang the song of colours in unison; The lake was blue, green and yellow all at once. At that particular instant I wanted time to freeze; alas! That was not an option. We left with a heavy heart, and a determined soul to come back sooner than later. We followed the same trail embracing each moment to catch our jeep where we left it a couple of days back. We were very lucky to have a good driver who would laugh in our jokes, and add his own wit. We spent our night at Nagma, retaliating entire journey, and reminding oneself that it was going to end soon. Day 5: Typically, we had to reach to Amilia by hook or by cook that day, which is a 13 hours drive from Nagma, and I personally respect our driver for achieving it. We did breakfast in the same hotel we stayed,did our lunch in Manma and dinner somewhere after Bardiya National Park. We rushed to Ghorahi, Dang after dinner and at about two in the midnight, we reached there. Two of our friends departed to Kathmandu from their immediately. One who came in the jeep went along with it, and five of us headed towards Butwal. At about four in the morning, we finally got a bus that went Butwal so we took it. The 2am to 4am wait in Ghorahi for the bus is a story for next time. Overall Expenses:  From KTM to Amilia, Dang : 1400 Rupees (You can get a cheaper fare) From Amilia to Rara and back to Ghorahi : 11000 Rupees From Ghorahi to Butwal : 200 Rupees From Ghorahi to Kathmandu : 1 Thousand Rupees (You can get a cheaper fare)"
