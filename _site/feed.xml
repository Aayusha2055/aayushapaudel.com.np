        <title>Kathmandu Food Tour | Local Eateries</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;WE LOVE KATHMANDU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite of polluted areas and chaos of the place, it has its own local cuisine with beautiful aspects and a strong grip in the taste of food which has won our hearts . 
And it is very important that you know, where to eat and what to eat.
People involved in satisfying customers with their food try their best to deliver a good taste to the tongue as they are the taste makers. And when
it comes to locals presenting their food in the market, undeniably, they’re the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People do like to find places with amazing ambiance and food to chill and eat, but are most often busy and short
of money. So they want foods that are fast and tastes delicious. Often they follow their friend’s recommendation
or food instagrammers but their recommendation can have significant sway over you and where you have your next meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some top local eateries around Kathmandu that you might want to try out if you’re around that street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;khyaroolms-momo-sukedhara&quot;&gt;Khyaroolm’s Momo, Sukedhara&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any Nepali that doubts in momos , are either not Nepali, or  have never tried momos.  Nepalese people
want momos any season in any weather. And Khyarloom’s momo has undoubtedly been able to please their customers since the past 40 years.
Run by locals in the streets of Sukedhara, their momo and their peanut sauce is a match made in heaven. The size of the momo
is big enough for your tummy to be full with eight to ten pieces. Every item you eat costs you at most of 120Rs, with enough
serving size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h5 id=&quot;location&quot;&gt;Location&lt;/h5&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;After you get to Sukedhara Chowk, take the alley beside the Traffic office. A minute of walk leads you to 
Laxmi Bank Chowk. Take right untill you reach a three way junction. Take left from the junction and you will find Global Cafe
to your left. On your right, a bit ahead of Global cafe, is where Khyarloom is located.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Khaarlyoom+Momo/@27.7302662,85.3475831,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x9d34963f08104762!8m2!3d27.7302662!4d85.3475831&quot;&gt;Click here to view location on the map.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rs-chinese-food-naxal&quot;&gt;R.S Chinese Food, Naxal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name might give you a hint about eating typical chinese food, but chinese food in local terms
means eating delicious fast food. R.S Chinese Food at Naxal offers you varieties of fast food starting from fried sausage,
mushroom, tofu, drumstick, meat ball or fresh steamed momos, fried rice, nepali stir fried noodles, burgers and many more
all served with their inhouse special sauce at amazing price with amazing quantity. It is very cheap and tasty at
the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h5 id=&quot;location-1&quot;&gt;Location&lt;/h5&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;After you reach to Naxal Bhagwati Temple, take the road towards Naxal. This place is about two stores away from the temple.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/R.S+Chinese+Food/@27.7130299,85.3288854,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xcc10dbb1dc3441a?sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwiJvcXpzoHkAhWCV30KHYvqABMQ_BIwE3oECA8QCA&quot;&gt;Click here to view location on the map.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;halal-dhobidhara-marg&quot;&gt;Halal, Dhobidhara Marg&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halal is another local eateries in Kathmandu, that serves you delicious biryani at the cheapest rate. There are several other places that
serves you authentic biryani as well, but they are extremely expensive. And that’s how hunting a place that serves authentic
biryani was important to me. When I finally found the place, I was excited to try my taste 
They serve a plate for 200Rs only. The spices in their biryani is rich.The sad part is that because the preparation takes time, they only serve
it on Sundays, Tuesdays and Fridays. Personally, for a biryani lover like me, it’s a win win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h5 id=&quot;location-2&quot;&gt;Location&lt;/h5&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This place lies in between the alley beside City Center towards Putalisadak.
Take the alley beside City Center towards QFX Kumari. About 500 meters ahead, to your right, you will find this shop, which looks
like a tea shop that has a hoarding board written halal in it. Make sure, you carefully walk the whole way and not miss it. You can even ask the locals around if you get confused.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Halal+Fast+Food/@27.70838,85.3230188,19z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x39eb1907d340e08d:0x972d3cee45263fde!8m2!3d27.7083802!4d85.3235659&quot;&gt;Click here to view location on the map.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;syankos-katti-roll&quot;&gt;Syanko’s Katti Roll&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Syanko’s Katti Roll can now be phrased as the “national katti roll”, as their branches are quite spread all over the valley now, serving us delicious rolls since the past fifteen years. My personal one around Kathmandu lies at two places, one at Sinamangal, which not only offers you delicious
rolls, but also has variety of other fast foods and the other one lies at Baneshwor, whose menu is limited to rolls only. These are the
oldest Syanko’s Rolls at Kathmandu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h5 id=&quot;location-3&quot;&gt;Location&lt;/h5&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Syanko’s Rolls are scattered in various places. You can find the store nearby you easily in the maps.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Syanko+Katti+Rolls/@27.6959163,85.3501305,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x39eb1987cb678083:0xa6c118f00289fbb8!8m2!3d27.6959163!4d85.3523192&quot;&gt;Click here to view the location of Sinamangal Branch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;khawa-kharpo-noodles-factory-fulbari-bouddha&quot;&gt;Khawa Kharpo Noodles Factory, Fulbari, Bouddha&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you happen to be around Bouddha, noodles of Khawa Kharpo is a must try. The shop lies at about five minutes walk from
the stupa and serves you the best plate of noodles you’ll ever eat. As the name of the place “factory”,  the noodles are their in-house
production. They produce the noodles, cook it and serve you fresh right in front of your eyes. It generally opens up after 11 A.M so make
sure you don’t go there for breakfast. White boiled noodles, served with fresh Chinese Spinach with the choice of your toppings(buff or egg)
and their sauce is actually a treat to your taste buds. They also serve another Tibetan dish named “Laphing”, which also is worth a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h5 id=&quot;location-4&quot;&gt;Location&lt;/h5&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;After you get into the gates of Bouddha, make a round from your left until you find an alley. Take that alley, and go straight.
You will soon find out series of laphing joints. After you pass onto chatterbox laphing, you will find the shop in your left.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Khawa+Karpo+Tasty+Noodle+Factory/@27.7246606,85.3644082,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x4bc10d04292510d7!8m2!3d27.7246606!4d85.3644082&quot;&gt;Click here to view location on the map.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tip-top-samosa-pasal-swachapu-marga&quot;&gt;TIP TOP Samosa Pasal, Swachapu Marga&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tip top has undoubtedly been able to win hearts of Nepalese with their samosas and variety of other indian sweets and foods. The reason why
there’s this huge crowd at every outlet of Tip Top is because of their samosas. Samosa is simply mashed potatoes with spices stuffed inside
a flat dough, made into a triangle and deep fried. A piece of samosa at tip top costs you twenty five rupees only and two would
be enough for a hungry stomach. They serve it with their house sauce that’s tangy and sweet at the same time. The samosa goes really
well with the sweet-tangy sauce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h5 id=&quot;location-5&quot;&gt;Location&lt;/h5&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Tip Top Sweets at Kathmandu is located in several places. There are a total of four outlets in the valley and three of them lies in Kathmandu
whereas the other one lies in Lalitpur.
The authentic samosa pasal of Tip Top however is situated on the road from Bishal Bazar to Indrachowk.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tip+Top+Samosa+Pasal/@27.7100067,85.308241,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x39eb18fe8e321937:0xfea16a198f4e9a7e!8m2!3d27.710002!4d85.310435&quot;&gt;Click here to view location on the map.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;npp-fast-food-newroad&quot;&gt;NPP Fast Food, Newroad&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any fast food lover in Nepal loves what NPP has to offer and specially its their in house sauce that has won hearts ever since.
People here basically loves NPP and the variety of stick foods along with their momo. NPP Food Service also has successfully been
able to open various outlets in the valley. You should definitely try out their sausage, potato sticks, tofu and momo if you ever happen
to be there. Another recommendation would be to have their c-momo with is a win win too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h5 id=&quot;location-6&quot;&gt;Location&lt;/h5&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When you reach to Bishal Bazar at New Road, take your left until you reach a junction. About five minutes walk and you’ll find this amazing food joint 
in your right.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/NPP+Food+Service/@27.7033473,85.3093825,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x39eb191227c506d1:0xc9e97cd54f827cb7!8m2!3d27.7033426!4d85.3115765&quot;&gt;Click here to view location on the map.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;jhigu-che-ganeshthan&quot;&gt;Jhigu Che, Ganeshthan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jhigu che by far is my top favourite newari food joints around Kathmandu. Located in the heart of Chabahil, this place
serves you authentic newari cuisine with best of flavours. A family run local shop has a limited items in their menu but they have
been able to take their creativity to a different level by inventing water momo. Water momo is basically momo made by 
boiling in the water. When we asked how was it possible, the chef explained that it took him almost six months to finally success
into making water boiled momos. They have the tastiest veg choila i.e. soyabean served with mixed spices in town. This place
is definitely a must visit place if you are around Chabahil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h5 id=&quot;location-7&quot;&gt;Location&lt;/h5&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you are at Chabhil chowk then take the alley towards Ganeshthan Temple. About 500 meters straight towards Mitrapark into the alley and
you’ll find this place on your left.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Jheegu+Cheen+Newari+Stick+Food/@27.7145755,85.3428871,18z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x39eb1970677994c1:0x335a4e66dc203180!8m2!3d27.7155027!4d85.3433754&quot;&gt;Click here to view location on the map.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;burger-freak-freak-street&quot;&gt;Burger Freak, Freak Street&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burgers are my personal favourite and when this place flooded into food blogger’s instagram I had to try it. On visiting the shop, I
was quite amazed to find out the price they had set for every burgers. Trying their special burger is by far the best food
that has ever happened to me. All the burgers range upto 250Rs which is totally satisfying as you are served delicious burger 
with enough fillings. If you ever happen to be around Freak Street, DO NOT MISS this burger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h5 id=&quot;location-8&quot;&gt;Location&lt;/h5&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When you reach freak street, abit ahead of Palpasa Cafe, you will find an alley that goes to Snowman cafe. Burger Freak
is about a hundred meters away from snowman’s cafe.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Burger+Freak/@27.7024963,85.3059958,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x39eb193ca6629d3d:0x79e3007e55d2bcd5!8m2!3d27.7024916!4d85.3081898&quot;&gt;Click here to view location on the map.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;snowman-cafe-freak-street&quot;&gt;Snowman Cafe, Freak Street&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snowman cafe is one of the oldest cafe of freak street. They have been able to win hearts of their customers since the past
50 years, and literally everyone knows about this place. This is one of those places which has amazing memory of every college 
students. People go here for their cakes and coffees and they are delicious and affordable at the same time. Snowman’s cafe now has a vintage touch since 
the interior hasn’t been changed or renovated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h5 id=&quot;location-9&quot;&gt;Location&lt;/h5&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There’s a small alley that connects freak street to Neworad. Just take the alley and the cafe lies two house away.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Snowman+Cafe/@27.7024711,85.3057156,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x39eb18567c0902ab:0x6953acf71c7af024!8m2!3d27.7024664!4d85.3079096&quot;&gt;Click here to view location on the map.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;grill-durbar-sankhamul&quot;&gt;Grill Durbar, Sankhamul&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ever crave for a big piece of grilled meat, then my friend, grill durbar is your ultimate saviour. Grill durbar
has a variety on the grills starting from normal to extremely spicy to normal ones. It is loaded with flavours and the spicy sauce
they serve along with is to die for. With very reasonable price, though this place doesn’t seem to be a local one,
it is a small shop with large packets of flavours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h5 id=&quot;location-10&quot;&gt;Location&lt;/h5&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;From Baneshowr Chowk, you got to take the road to Sankhamul. You have to go downhill untill you find a turning. Grill durbar is
right at your left when you take the turning to the left.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Grill+Durbar/@27.6844814,85.3315228,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x39eb199ef575be35:0x65ba0ddf1c394dfb!8m2!3d27.6844767!4d85.3337168&quot;&gt;Click here to view location on the map.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several other places that serves you delicious foods at amazing prices. I have only highlighted the places located at
Kathmandu. Soon, I will be writing on local eateries around Lalitpur.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>First Travel Blog | RARA</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A group of eight friends, some who knew each other very well, while some who had no idea who the rest of them would be, abruptly decided to go on a trip to the far western land of Nepal.
Travelling usually takes a lot of patience, specially when the place you’re about to go has difficult roads, difficult transportation facilities and the most important one: when you’re budget travelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Travelling far away with friends as we scramble in the roads, it honestly is a unifying bond that doesn’t discriminate or judge. Packed up and ready from the bus park in Kathmandu, we headed towards Amilia, Dang where a friend of ours awaited with a reserved jeep.
The bus took off at seven in the evening and so did our adrenalin. With lots of stories to share, and extreme junk food packages, the road trip to Amilia ended in a blink of an eye.
Travelling allows you to enjoy to the fullest, warms the depth of your soul and always leaves you curious with what the next minute has to offer. And that’s what we were, young and curious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The place we were headed was one of the best place Nepal has to offer to you. The place beyond the beautiful horizon and something that was phrased as, “Heaven is a myth. Rara is real”. When I think of it now, I feel as if my journey is a dream that fills
the root of my heart and gives me the feeling of accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rara lake is the biggest freshwater lake in Nepal. Situated in a small district of Nepal, Mugu, surrounded by hills all around at an altitude of 2990m is one of the must visit place in Nepal. Often times people assume that you got to trek to reach there,
but we have several other ways to explore western Nepal and the lake itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ways-to-travel&quot;&gt;WAYS TO TRAVEL&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;airways&quot;&gt;Airways&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take a flight from Kathmandu to Nepalgunj and from Nepalgunj to Talcha Airport. Rara lake is four hour hike away from Talcha airport.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can also take a flight from Nepalgunj to Jumla. From Jumla you need to either take a bus or jeep to Gamagadhi. Gamagadhi is the district headquarters of Mugu. The lake is five hours hike from Gamagadhi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;roadways&quot;&gt;Roadways&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take a bus to Surkhet or Nepalgunj. You can get a bus to Kalikot which would be a whole day drive. From Kalikot, you got to switch bus to Nagma and from Nagma another bus that leads to Gamagadhi. As mentioned earlier, the lake is five hours hike from Gamagadhi. 
The bus travels along the famous Karnali Highway.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second and the most flexible and comfortable way would be to reserve a jeep. You do not necessarily need to reserve it from the place you live in. We travelled to Dang by bus and 
reserved a jeep there for five days which cost us around forty five thousand Nepali Rupees for eight people.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;trek&quot;&gt;Trek&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rara lies in the Karnali region that has amazing landscapes and experience the authentic western past of Nepal from food to people. 
You can find several options in the internet if you look for Khaptak trek that en routes Rara Lake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;travel-like-we-did&quot;&gt;TRAVEL LIKE WE DID&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;day-1&quot;&gt;Day 1&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First day of our travel actually started at 7pm in the evening, in the night bus, with friends on the highway to Western Nepal. I personally knew everyone of them, but yes, there were people who hadn’t met each other their entire life.
To be honest, travelling with strangers lets you leave your shit behind and focus only on the wonderful stories to talk about. The challenge this time was not only to explore a different environment but also new people and let your guards down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like mentioned earlier we took a bus from Kathmandu upto Amilia, Dang where a friend of ours was waiting with a reserved jeep and started our road trip.
One of the best part of tripping around west is the fields on Terai, the vibes Bardiya National Park gives in between and the variety of animals you spot in between. We had our lunch in Kohalpur and headed towards Surkhet. And would you even call it a road trip if your tire doesn’t get punctured at least once? Plannings beforehand did let us know that our destination for the day was Manma,
but because punctured tire took time, we started late and reached to Rakham that night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;accommodation-at-rakam&quot;&gt;Accommodation at Rakam&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can pretty much expect good accommodation upto Surkhet but after that you meet people who might even sleep at the floor but give you their bed. Sometimes, it’s the materialistic things people want, but when someone would sacrifice their comfort for yours, that’s when you know, you’ve met a good soul. 
People there do not have much to offer except for what they have and that honestly stands out. At Rakham, you do not find big hotels but you can find enough home with bigger hearts. The one we stayed had a family of five who made us delicious Nepali Thali, with a taste of Karnali, cooked in fire with love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we asked what they would cost for a night, they said we only need to pay for the food and pay what we feel like for the accommodation. We then paid three thousand rupees to the family of the home stay and they gave us warm farewell full of blessings and good luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;day-2&quot;&gt;Day 2&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second day started with much excitement than the previous one because the lake awaited us more than anything. Reaching Manma the first day would have made our schedule up to time, but when they say whatever happens, happens for best, they are true. Our next stop for lunch was Nagma. The road to Nagma wasn’t that sophisticated but people we were with taught us to live in the moment and enjoy it. As the roads started getting complex,
friends started getting simpler. And when we finally rested our butts out of the jeep in Nagma, the view we had in front of us was amazing. The barren hills, the over speed flow of river, the sound the water flow was making, at most 10 houses attached with one other, and people with rough red cheeks did let us realize that people do live in such places which had nothing yet everything. The river that flows had the purest freshwater.
The views, the bridges and small architect in them that signifies Kings and Queens were worth the watch. Since we were half day late according to the schedule we had made, so after filling our tummy with yummy food at Nagma we decided that we will not be stopping any way until we reach to our destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At about 6 in the evening we finally entered the Khaptad National Park region where we were suggested not to go further and rather spend the night somewhere
nearby but because we were so determined to see the lake before our eyes first thing in the morning we didn’t stop. At 9:30 pm we reached to Salleri, from where the road ends, and travellers have to hike. The locals there suggested us to stay rather than to hike at night, but our young blood, fueled hormones didn’t let us stop. So finally, in the cold windy shivering weather of Rara, we decided to walk up until we reach to our hotel. I tell you, the hike was worth the effort we had made
until then, worth the equation everyone shares today, and worth the bond that got stronger. When we finally reached our hotel at about past midnight, we were warmly welcomed with hot waters and fresh food. We got our tents and finally slept not knowing what the day after had to offer us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;day-3&quot;&gt;Day 3&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since waking up to the lake was what everyone of us had in our mind, early morning at Rara had a surprise for us. It snowed for the first time that year, and the view was worth the travel. Google pictures of Rara always had few of them covered with snow, but to see it right in front of your eyes, the process, where slowly all the greens turn into white withing a short span of time is breathtaking. The only thing that was disturbing was the unconditional cold that 
wasn’t going anywhere until the sun showed up. And no matter how much you want the snow, you’ll eventually crave for the sun. The only way to beat the cold weather was to hike around the biggest freshwater lake and few minutes later, the beauty of lake warms you up naturally. We were served delicious breakfast that morning, that had roasted potatoes, omelet, typical nepali chapatis of buckwheat and a warm cup of tea. We spent the rest of the day, in front of the lake, 
admiring its beauty. Few friends of mine, further hiked to Murma Top, which is said to be the view-point of Rara.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;day-4&quot;&gt;Day 4&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After having our breakfast the morose thought of leaving this place hit me I did not want to leave. But like the old saying goes, “All good things must come to an end”, it was time to bid farewell to this beautiful place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Rara decided to give us a warm and sunny goodbye. As we sail our boat on the lake the sun and the lake sang the song of colours in unison; The lake was blue, green and yellow all at once. At that particular instant I wanted time to freeze; alas! That was not an option. We left with a heavy heart, and a determined soul to come back sooner than later. We followed the same trail embracing each moment to catch our jeep where we left it a couple of days back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were very lucky to have a good driver who would laugh in our jokes, and add his own wit. We spent our night at Nagma, retaliating entire journey, and reminding oneself that it was going to end soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;day-5&quot;&gt;Day 5&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, we had to reach to Amilia by hook or by cook that day, which is a 13 hours drive from Nagma, and I personally respect our driver for achieving it. We did breakfast in the same hotel we stayed,
did our lunch in Manma and dinner somewhere after Bardiya National Park. We rushed to Ghorahi, Dang after dinner and at about two in the midnight, we reached there. Two of our friends departed to Kathmandu from their immediately. One who came in the jeep went along with it, and five of us headed towards Butwal. At about four in the morning, we finally got a bus that went Butwal so we took it. The 2am to 4am wait in Ghorahi for the bus is a story for next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;overall-expenses-per-person&quot;&gt;Overall Expenses (Per Person)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;From KTM to Amilia, Dang : 1400 Rupees (You can get a cheaper fare)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;From Amilia to Rara and back to Ghorahi : 11000 Rupees&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;From Ghorahi to Butwal : 200 Rupees&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;From Ghorahi to Kathmandu : 1 Thousand Rupees (You can get a cheaper fare)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
